Release Notes
------------

1.1 (11/18/11 - Mac Only)

* WebSocket communication
* Kinect support
* Minimize: run TSPS in lean, mean, mini mode (tiny window, all on-screen drawing skipped)
* OF 007 compatible 
* Misc bug fixes (found more? email feedback@opentsps.com)

WebSockets
------------

* To turn on WebSocket communication (on by default in 1.1), select the Communication panel in the GUI and edit the WebSockets panel at the very bottom.
* To test your WebSocket, simply compile/run openTSPS, then navigate your browser to localhost:PORT, where PORT is the port that is specified in the GUI. By default it's localhost:7681.
* To have extra fun, open that same URL in a bunch of browser windows.
* To have the most fun, open up another computer to http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT
* The html/js/css that is served is in bin/data/web. It's very barebones... Hack away at it, please.
* Making your own JS TSPS clients is easy (and they don't have to live in the bin/data/web directory); the TSPS WebSocket sender sends JSON, so you don't even have to use our JS files if you don't want to.
