About
------------
TSPS is a toolkit for sensing people in spaces. It uses openCV to analyze a camera, kinect, or video data, and sends what it finds via OSC, TCP, TUIO, or Websockets. 

Compiling: Mac OS X
------------
*note:* the TSPS standalone app is Mac-only for now. Please feel free to take a 
crack at the standalone app for other platforms!

1. clone openframeworks from here: [https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks](https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks )
2. clone the TSPS directory into openframeworks/
3. open the XCode project in openTSPS/standalone/basic
4. compile and run!

Troubleshooting
------------
* If you have trouble compiling, experience crashes, or need any general help, please visit the [TSPS Forum] (http://opentsps.com/forum)

WebSockets
------------

* To turn on WebSocket communication (on by default in 1.1), select the Communication panel in the GUI and edit the WebSockets panel at the very bottom.
* To test your WebSocket, simply compile/run openTSPS, then navigate your browser to localhost:PORT, where PORT is the port that is specified in the GUI. By default it's localhost:7681.
* To have extra fun, open that same URL in a bunch of browser windows.
* To have the most fun, open up another computer to http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:PORT
* Making your own JS TSPS clients is easy (and they don't have to live in the bin/data/web directory); the TSPS WebSocket sender sends JSON, so you don't even have to use our JS files if you don't want to.
